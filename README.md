# ft_transcendence
run make and then connect to https://localhost:4433

If you want to test backend and frontend seperately without docker
npm run build in root of frontend and then copy the dist to backend/api/frontend/dist
then run node index.js in backend/api/





npm run dev in the root = dev mode. Make sure you have .env files in each service and npm installs done
Also, frontend has now two .env's you can just "cp env.development .env.develpment" and same for production or modify the variables
make (basic) = production
