ðŸ“Œ Transcendence Kickoff Notes

- Agreed realistic timeframe 2 months (mid of may)

- There are 17 major modules and 11 minor modules
- We need 7 major and 2 minors make 1 major

Main themes we like to focus on according to the discussion and some modules from those:
  Web:
      - Backend (Backend itself is not a module we can just have it or not and if we have it it must be php but if we choose the module then it's Fastify with Node.js)
      - Backend database (minor)
      
  User Management:
      - Std user management
      - Remote authentication (Google sign-in)?
      
  Game-Play and user experience:
      - remote players????

  Cybersecurity:
      - Implement WAF/ModSecurity with a hardened configuration and HashiCorp Vault for secrets management.
      - GDPR shit?
      -  Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and JWT?

  Devops:
      Major module: Infrastructure setup for log management.
      Minor module: Monitoring system.
      Major module: Designing the backend as microservices.

  Accessibility:
      Some "easy" useless minor module?

  Server side pong:
      Major module: Replace basic Pong with server-side Pong and implement a API?

So, the focus is not really on the game play or user experience but more technical stuff like cybsec, user mngmt and devops.
